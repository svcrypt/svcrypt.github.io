            <h3>What is Svencryptor? </h3>
            <p>Svencryptor is a basic encryptor with a built-in decryptor which uses a pretty simple and easy to understand cipher. 
                The goal of this project is not to build a secure encryptor but to explain the beauty of cryptography in layman's terms so that everyone
                can acquire a basic understanding of the topic as it is used nearly everywhere a gadget is located.

            <h3>Some basic terms associated wtih cryptography</h3>
            <p>Before we continue, there are certain terms which you need to be familiar with in order to understand the topic. The following words are listed below with their respective definitions.</p>
            <div class="card">
                <div class="card-body">Cipher - a secret or disguised way of writing; a code.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <div class="card-body">Encryption - the process of converting information or data into a code, especially to prevent unauthorized access.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <div class="card-body">Decryption - the conversion of encrypted data into its original form</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div id="3">
            <h3>The necessity of cryptography</h3>
            <p>Data shouldn't always publically be accessible to everyone, you don't want your transactional information to be seen by unauthorized information, in situations like this, cryptography comes into play
                as it allows data to be shared securely so that only authorized individuals can access it. Currently, we have highly secure ciphers which are uncrackable so it's safe to say that 
                data is no longer unsecure because of the vast use of cryptography among confidential systems. It is a fascinating topic which is often misunderstood to be "too complex" because there aren't any 
                beginner friendly introduction to it. This project aims to provide just that.

            <h3>Cipher</h3>
            <p>Cipher is the cornerstone of cryptography, you can think of it as a technique which is used to hide data. The same technique must also be known to someone else for them to retrieve the original data which is often referred to as 'plaintext'. You can find more information regarding the various types of cipher <a href="http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/" target="_blank">here</a>. The cipher which was used in
            Svencryptor was a caesar cipher with a little twist. SVE (SV Encryptor) takes in the plaintext given by the user and reverses it first. After reversing it, each character's ASCII value is incremented by 4 so that it's a different character. That is the entire process behind SVE's encryption. SVD (SV Decryptor) reverses this process to
            convert the encrypted string into plaintext.</p>

        <div id="5">
            <h3>Isn't this a bit unsafe?</h3>
            <p>You might think that revealing the entire process here is unsafe and come to the assumption that SVE shouldn't be used to encrypt important information. You'd be right to do so as Svencryptor's sole purpose is to introduce cryptography as a concept and not to actually encrypt stuff securely. This is just an example of how 
                encryption should be implemented.
